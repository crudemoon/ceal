CEAL is a C-based language for self-adjusting computation. CEAL
extends (a somewhat restricted subset of) C with a small set of
primitives that allow programmers to write self-adjusting computations
in a manner similar to conventional C programming. CEAL code can both
call and be called by conventional C code.
