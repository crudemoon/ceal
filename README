= CEAL README =

CEAL is a C-based language for self-adjusting computation. CEAL
extends (a somewhat restricted subset of) C with a small set of
primitives that allow programmers to write self-adjusting computations
in a manner similar to conventional C programming. CEAL code can both
call and be called by conventional C code.


== People ==

The CEAL project is supervised by Umut A Acar (umut@mpi-sws.org), and
its primary developer is Matthew Hammer (hammer@mpi-sws.org).

Where applicable, the CEAL source code should contain relevant author
information on a file-by-file basis. As an overview, the following
people have contributed code to the current system:

Ezgi Cicek (Benchmark applications)
Yan Chen (Run-time support for imperative memory)
Reinhard Munz (Benchmark applications)
Mike Rainey (Benchmark applications)


== Wiki Resources ==

We intend to provide complete manuals, how-tos and other user support
in wiki form. The homepage for CEAL is the following:
