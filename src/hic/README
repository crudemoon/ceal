HiC is a C preprocessor idea that I was toying around with, after
getting tired of (mis)using the C preprocessor to implement
functor-like patterns.

In a nutshell, it's a C preprocessor whose source syntax combines
OCaml module/functor syntax with C type- and function-declaration
syntax.

The output syntax is intended to be (automatically commented) C code,
which contains provenance information about the (macro-expanded and
erased) functor usage in the source syntax.
